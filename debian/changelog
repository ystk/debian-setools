  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * libsefs built with GCC 4.3 is not binary-compatible with itself built with

  * We really do need distinct symbols files for all the architectures,
    thanks to va_list; so, with 13 architectures, and 5 libraries, those
    are an added 65 files. However, this should fix the issue that setools
    failed to build on every single buildd out there.

  * On reflection (and in discussion on IRC), it dawned on me that the

    Missing function prototypes are likely to cause setools to segfault on

    Closes serious bug. Closes: #492776, #493830
    + This is the official release of SETools 3.3.5.
    + Fixed errors in libapol's AV and TE rule rendering functions
      where errno was not being set properly.
    + Fixed error in apol_syn_avrule_render() where braces were not
      being added around the target set when there is exactly one target
      type and the keyword 'self'.  Thanks to Ryan Kagin for reporting
      this error.
    + Synched libqpol to libsepol version 2.0.32, policy parser to
      2.0.16.
    + Synched libqpol to libsepol version 2.0.26, policy parser to

      version 23 policy; bumped libqpol to version 1.4.

setools (3.3.4.ds-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add automake as a build dependency.  We need to add automake as a
    buuild dependency, since we use autoreconf, which tries to run aclocal
    and automake. We used to just depend on autoconf, which just
    recommends automake -- which was therefore never pulled in on the
    build daemons. This is a gotcha unless your build environment does not
    install recommends by default.

  * Bug fix: "setools - FTBFS: Error: symbol `fstatat64&#39; is already

    a -D__attreibute(x)='' setting in libseaudit/swig/python/Makefile.am.
    There is nothing in the commit logs to indicate that his is a

    no regressions.                          (Closes: #474428, #474904).
  * Since we change configure.ac, and things in Makefile.am, run
    autoreconf -f to ensure that everything gets rebuilt.
  * Delete generated .xcf files, to prevent a FTBS when building twice

setools (3.3.4.ds-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change build dependencies to use python-all-dev, and compile for the
    default version, rather than hard coding version 2.4. This also paves
    the way for trying to compile support for more than one version of
    Python.
  * Simplify the long descriptions; users do not generally care for names
    of included binaries when selecting packages (and thus mitigate the
    possibility future package development would make the long description
    incorrect.
  * Add correct dependencies for setools; it depends on bwidget (>= 1.8)
    and tk.
  * Moved libraries needed by apol back into setools from
    libsetools-tcl. Thanks to Jason Trang for pointing out the above
    problems and providing fixes.

  * Since we have flex scanners built into our libapol shared libraries,
    and that needs to link with the flex library, which is static;
    therefore we need to explicitly link with libfl_pic, which has the
    position independent code required for all components of a shared
    library.
  * Split up setools into multiple packages, so that the shared libraries
    and devel tools can be provided separately. Split up the single
    package setools into several library packages, since it was pointed
    out to me that the package was in violation of §8.2 of the Debian
    policy.  Now each library has a runtime and a dev package, so each
    library can develop at its own pace.

setools (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
      * libsefs:
        Converted to use an on-disk SQLite database backend and
          re-designed API to provide the functionality to other
          applications, such as apol.
      * libapol:
        Added support for analyzing direct file relabels.
        Added support for analyzing relationship between two types.
        Integrated use of hashtable structures for easily analyzing
          differences between policies.
        Minor bug fixes.
      * libseuser:
        Minor bug fixes.
      * apol:
        New analysis module for performing direct file relabel
          analysis.
        New analysis module for analyzing the relationship be-
          tween two types.
        New interface added for viewing file contexts from an
          SELinux filesystem.
        Improvements to domain transition analysis interface.
        Minor bug fixes and GUI tweaks.
      * secmds:
        Updated indexcon/searchcon to use an on-disk SQLite database
          in order to decrease memory use. These changes are not
          backwards-compatible.
      * seaudit:
        Integrated reporting functionality into GUI.
        Minor GUI tweaks.
      * sediff:
        New gtk GUI and command-line tools for analyzing the semantic
          differences between two policies. The semantic difference
          of a policy is different from the syntactic difference in
          that it shows the cumulative effect of rules rather than
          doing a line-by-line comparison.
